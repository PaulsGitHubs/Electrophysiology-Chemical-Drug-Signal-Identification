# Electrophysiology-Drug-Signal-Identification

This repository aims to develop a system for detecting and classifying drugs based on the electromagnetic signatures emitted from the human body when consuming drugs. The hypothesis is that different drugs generate unique electromagnetic waves, which can be captured using an antenna and then classified to identify the substance.

## Introduction

Drug abuse is a global issue, leading to severe health problems and affecting communities in various ways. It is crucial to develop tools that can detect and identify drug consumption. This repository presents an approach using electromagnetic signatures released by the human body when consuming drugs. The goal is to classify these signals to identify the specific substance involved.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electrophysiology-drug-signal-identification.git
cd electrophysiology-drug-signal-identification
```
2. **Install the required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of electromagnetic signals collected from individuals who have consumed various drugs. It should include a diverse set of substances, demographic factors, and recording conditions. Each data point should have a corresponding label indicating the drug consumed.

**To prepare the dataset, follow these steps:**

1. Collect raw electromagnetic signals using an antenna.
2. Preprocess the data, removing noise and normalizing signal amplitude.
3. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
4. Save the data as `.npy` or `.csv` files in the `data/` directory.

## Model

The model can be a deep learning architecture such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or an ensemble of multiple models. The input should be the preprocessed electromagnetic signals, and the output should be the predicted drug class.

## Training

To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --epochs EPOCHS --batch_size BATCH_SIZE --lr LEARNING_RATE
```
where `EPOCHS`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `LEARNING_RATE` are the desired number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate, respectively.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, run the following command:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path PATH_TO_MODEL
```

The script will output the classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.

## Usage
To classify a new electromagnetic signal, run the following command:
```bash
python predict.py --model_path PATH_TO_MODEL --signal_path PATH_TO_SIGNAL
```

The script will output the predicted drug class for the input signal.
